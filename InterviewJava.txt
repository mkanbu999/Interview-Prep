A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to writing software. It defines the way in which a programmer thinks about the problem they are trying to solve, and the way in which they express the solution using the programming language.

There are several different programming paradigms, including:

Imperative programming, which focuses on describing a series of steps or operations that a computer should perform to achieve a specific task.
Object-oriented programming, which focuses on modeling software as a collection of interacting objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.
Functional programming, which emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and the avoidance of side effects.
Logical programming, which focuses on representing knowledge and solving problems using logic and logical reasoning.
Procedural programming, which focuses on breaking a problem down into a series of procedures or functions that are called in a specific order to solve the problem.
Each programming paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses and is better suited to certain types of problems than others. A programmer may choose to use a specific paradigm based on their personal preference, the problem they are trying to solve, or the constraints of the project.

Imperative programming in Java is a way of writing code that focuses on describing the steps or operations that a computer should perform to achieve a specific task. It uses statements that change the state of the program and variables can be modified.

Functional programming in Java is a way of writing code that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutability, it encourages the use of functional constructs like lambda expressions and function composition. The state of the program is not allowed to change and variables are immutable.

In simple words, imperative programming is like giving the computer a set of instructions on what to do, step by step. While functional programming is like giving the computer a set of rules to follow without changing the state of the program.


Imperative Programming:

public static int factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(factorial(5)); // 120
}



Functional Programming:

import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public static int factorial(int n) {
    return IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n)
                    .reduce(1, (x, y) -> x * y);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(factorial(5)); // 120
}
